! minbias production at the LHC
Beams:idA = 2212 ! first incoming beam is a 2212, i.e. a proton.
Beams:idB = 2212 ! second beam is also a proton.11
Beams:eCM = 13000. ! the cm energy of collisions.
SoftQCD:minBias = on ! switch on the process minBias
Main:numberOfEvents = 500000       ! number of events to generate
